This is a collection of my notes on particularly difficult problems, and how I arrived at the solution.

\section*{Median of Two Sorted Arrays}

Given two sorted arrays $x$ and $y$ of size $m$ and $n$ respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

\subsection*{Solution}

The best way to solve this problem is to use the merge algorithm, but halt the process once the median is reached. Keep track of two variables $i_1$ and $i_2$, which index $x$ and $y$ respectively. When
\begin{gather*}
i_1 + i_2 = \dfrac{m + n}{2}
\end{gather*}
we have the median. When implementing, in the case \( m + n \) is odd, the median is simply whatever value that should be located at the combined index, which is when
\begin{gather*}
i_1 + i_2 = \floor{ \dfrac{m + n}{2} }
\end{gather*}
In the case \( m + n \) is even, the median is the average of the lower and higher median, which is the two values located at
\begin{gather*}
i_1 + i_2 = \floor{ \dfrac{m + n}{2} } - 1\\
i_1 + i_2 = \floor{ \dfrac{m + n}{2} } 
\end{gather*}


\end{document}
